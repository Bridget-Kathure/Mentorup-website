    <h4 class="subtitle">Chapter 1 and 2</h4>
Trevor Noah's life story is a unique and challenging one, as he grew up in South Africa during the apartheid era. 
<br>Born to a black Xhosa mother and a Swiss father in 1984, he encountered various obstacles due to his mixed-race
<br>identity.The apartheid system was used by the Afrikaners to develop racial oppression, driving the native South 
<br>Africans from their lands into slavery. The Immorality Act of 1927 outlawed native black-and-white relationships,
<br>punishing men with not less than 5 years and women with 4 years. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Trevor's life was full of danger, and his mom even threw him off a moving bus to save their lives.In their lives,
<br>they are constantly fleeing either from the police officer looking to expose Trevor for being mixed race or Trevor 
<br>from his mom to escape beating.Despite all these challenges, Trevor's mother remained a strong,independent woman 
<br>with a staunch Christian faith.She never let discrimination hold her back and worked hard to secure a job outside 
<br>of the factory.She even dated her white neighbor, Robert, who would become Trevor's father. 
<br>
