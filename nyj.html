        <p>Trevor Noah talks about his upbringing in South Africa during the apartheid era, 
        <br>where he was born to a black Xhosa mother and a Swiss father in 1984. 
        <br>This led to a unique and challenging upbringing for Trevor during apartheid.
        <br>South Africa was divided into tribes, with the Xhosa and Zulu being the dominant tribes before apartheid. 
        <br>The Zulu warriors fought against Europeans, while the Xhosa learned from them. 
        <br>The colonizers used the tribe differences to turn them against each other to conquer them.
        <br>In 1927, an Immorality Act was passed that outlawed native black-and-white relationships, 
        <br>with a punishment of not less than 5 years for men and 4 for women. 
        <br>In the first chapter, Trevor describes his mother as a strong, independent, and staunch Christian.
        <br> We also see some of the violence in post-apartheid South Africa and the dangers
        <br> of the triumph of democracy over the apartheid situation. 
        <br>Trevor’s mom throws him off a moving bus to save their lives. In their lives, they are constantly fleeing 
        <br>either from the police officer looking to expose Trevor for being mixed race or Trevor from his mom to escape beating. 
        <br>There were entire police squads whose sole responsibility was to peep through windows,
        <br> a task for only the best law enforcement officers. If they found any sexual relationship between a black and a white, 
        <br>which was against the law, they would charge rape for a black man having intercourse with a white woman. 
        <br> Trevor’s mother never let discrimination hold her back. She had an apartment, went out with friends, 
        <br>and even dated her white neighbor, Robert, who would become Trevor's father. 
        <br> Patricia, Trevor's mother, was determined to make her way in the world and had to overcome significant obstacles to do so.
        <br> She worked hard, taking a typing course to secure a job outside of the factory, and even lived in a part of town where she faced many challenges.
        <br> Despite these difficulties, Patricia expressed her desire to have a child to Trevor's father, a Swiss man, who agreed to her request. 
        <br>In 1984, Patricia gave birth to a mixed-race child.
        <br>She defended Robert by claiming Trevor's father was from the adjacent kingdom of "Swaziland". 
        <br>She also returned to see her family after three years apart, and Trevor spent some time with them. 
        <br>Trevor was frequently kept indoors to avoid being spotted, endangering the entire family's safety. 
        <br>If he had been discovered, his grandma and mother would most certainly have been arrested.
        <br>The chapters relate to the recent society by highlighting the themes of social injustices and racial inequalities. 
        <br>Trevor’s experiences serve as a reminder of the struggles and progress in society’s journey toward equality and acceptance. 
        <br>Trevor's experiences highlight the importance of family in life and how it shapes our attitudes and behaviors. </p>
